# apstrahub-configpack-change-nh

This repository contains an ApstraHub ConfigPack.

ConfigPack documentation intended for end users is required to appear [here, in the README.md file in the `pack` directory](./pack/README.md). Check that file for details about this ConfigPack.

This file is strictly boilerplate from the [config-pack-example repo](https://github.com/chrismarget-j/apstrahub),
but a pack author/publisher may choose to modify it as they work through the
[publisher documentation](https://github.com/chrismarget-j/apstrahub-configpack-example/blob/main/publisher_guide/README.md)
to give additional context to readers browsing the ConfigPack on GitHub.
