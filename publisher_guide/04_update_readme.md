# Update the README

The `README.md` document at the root of this template repository describes the template. When
a repository is created _from the template_, the readme should probably describe the new
repository.

Note that `README.md` is a different file from `pack/README.md`. The former is intended to explain
the purpose of the repository to GitHub users, while the latter explains the purpose of the _pack_
to Apstra Hub users.

It would also be reasonable to remove the `publisher_guide/` directory at this time.
