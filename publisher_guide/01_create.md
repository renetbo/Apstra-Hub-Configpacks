This repository is a GitHub Repository _Template_. New repositories based on this one can be easily
created using GitHub's web UI.


Begin the process of creating a new repository based on this one by by clicking [here](https://github.com/new?template_owner=chrismarget-j&template_name=apstrahub-configpack-example).

The name you select for the new repository must be prefixed with `apstrahub-configpack-`. ApstraHub will drop the
prefix and render the remainder of the name as the pack title. In the pack title, _hyphens_ will be replaced with
_space_, and _double hyphen_ will be replaced with _hyphen_.

For example, `apstrahub-configpack-IPv4--IPv6-Rules` will be rendered in ApstraHub as _IPv4-IPv6 Rules_.

The new repository must be public.
